# This is a clone of the Bible App
I wanted to try and make a similar app that has a lot of the same functionality as the Bible app.

## Goals to hit
- Allow Users to highlight, and remove highlighted verses. X
- Allow for Changing the font and font size of the reading text. X
- Allow for users to have a profile image and username  (even tho this is a local app only) X
- Allow for dark mode. X
- Allow for notes in scripture
- Allow for a user to copy/share the verse and have the reference with it.

## About this app and how to run it
This app is made with HTML5, CCS3, and Js/Jquery library.
- Download this project and open it in your code editor
- Next, right-click the HTML and "Open with live server"

The best way to view this app is in mobile view.
